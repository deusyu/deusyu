## Repository Purpose

This is a GitHub profile README repository (github.com/deusyu/deusyu). The README.md displays on the GitHub profile page.

## Content Guidelines

The README follows the author's philosophy: "Human defines boundaries, AI fills details" and "context engineering > prompt engineering".

When updating the README:
- Maintain the existing structure: Recent Posts, Current Focus, Tech Stack, Philosophy, Find Me
- The `<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START/END -->` comments are placeholders for automated blog post updates
- Keep the minimalist, systems-thinking tone
